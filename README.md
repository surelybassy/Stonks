## Outline

The project started as a simple data analysis project, as I wanted to try out some different techniques for financial analysis and prediction. After the initial analysis, I decided to continue the project with more of a focus on data engineering, using Python with the Dash and Plotly libraries to build a tool that can be deployed in the cloud to provide live updates.
