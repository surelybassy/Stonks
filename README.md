# Stock Market Analysis
Data analysis and engineer project

## Outline

The project started as a simple data analysis practice, as I wanted to try out some different techniques for financial analysis and prediction. After the initial analysis, I decided to continue the project with more of a focus on data engineering, using Python with the Dash and Plotly libraries to build a tool that can be deployed in the cloud to provide live information.

## Analysis and Predications

Initial analysis took place using Jupyter Notebook. The Pandas-datatreader was used to pul the data of different companies stock information from Yahoo into a dataframe. Then used Seaborn to visualise the results.

Using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technique to build a predictive model from the first 80% of the data set, I would then predict the outcome for the remaining 20% and compare the results to the actual stock prices.
